\begin{abstract}
 Rescue operations for individuals lost in a forest require drones to quickly scan a large unknown environment and quickly provide relief. We propose to work on this problem by making multiple drones cooperatively scan the entire area with unknown obstacles communicating with each other to create a single map.

                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
