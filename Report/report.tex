\begin{abstract}
 Rescue operations for individuals lost in a forest require drones to quickly scan a large unknown environment and quickly provide relief. We propose to work on this problem by breaking it into 2 stages. 1) multiple drones cooperatively scan the entire area with unknown obstacles communincating with each other to create a single map. 2) Once a person is found, another drone can be sent from the base to their location to provide relief by finding an optimal path.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
