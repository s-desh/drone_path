Objective: Navigation of a quadcopter in a dynamic environment with multiple obstacles moving in a random motion. Obstacles are represented by cylinders which may represent people moving around in an indoor environment.\\
Environment: We will use PyBulletDrone environment for this project\\
Assumptions: The instantaneous state of the system, including instantaneous positions and sizes of all obstacles, is available to the motion planning algorithm.\\
Procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with a vanilla \(RRT^*\) algorithm that generates the trajectory in a static environment.
    \item Sampling is done from a 12D C-space (Position, Velocity) taking the kinodynamics of the rotor into account.
    \item Then make the quadcopter follow this path using an off the shelf control algorithm.
    \item Implement different flavours of the RRT algorithm for dynamic environments. 
    \item Compare these algorithm on the basis of their compute time and the path length.
\end{enumerate}

Questions: Should we search for the optimal path in the 3D World space or the 6D C-Space of the robot or 12D Position + Velocity space?
