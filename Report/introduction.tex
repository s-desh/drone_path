Multiple drones efficiently navigate and survey an unfamiliar environment which is broken down into a grid and systematically covering each cell in a cooperative manner.
The drones identify obstacles within their vicinity, relay the information to a central map, and update it collaboratively.
In this project, we leverage the PyBulletDrone\cite{panerati2021learning} environment, where we have randomnly placed trees.
The robots sense these obstacles as they enter the sensing range of their onboard sensors.
Our approach employs a global planner, guiding drones in a Breadth First Search fashion.
Communication with a central node ensures strategic exploration, preventing overlap between two drones.
The global planner dictates each drone's target location.
Utilizing the \(RRT^*\) algorithm on the common map, we plan paths for the drones, subsequently employing the PID algorithm to precisely follow these paths.
