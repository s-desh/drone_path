We use multiple drones to efficiently scout a forest environment. The goal is to reduce 
total time for scouting the region by implementing a two motion planners, one each at 
global and local levels.

For simulating, we leverage the PyBulletDrone\cite{panerati2021learning} environment, 
where trees are spawned at random locations and the drones navigate to specific goals. 
The drones detect obstacles as they enter the sensing range of onboard sensors. 
Our approach employs a global planner, guiding drones in a Breadth First Search fashion 
followed by local planning done by RRT*. 

The global planner provides way-points for each drone such that the entire forest is scouted. 
All way-points are considered as local intermediate goals used to reveal slices of the 
global occupancy map to the drone, which navigates using a obstacle free path provided by the 
\(RRT^*\) algorithm. Subsequently the drone uses PID control to precisely follow these paths.\\

We conclude by showing significant computation gains due to two reasons - the multi planner 
approach while solving RRT* on local occupancy maps.
